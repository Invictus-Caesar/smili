Q: I get the "missing vtkEventQt*.h file" error when I try to build SMILI. What's wrong?

A: Ensure VTK is built with USE_QT to ON, or if using packages, ensure the libvtk*-qt*-dev* package is installed.

Q: Can I automate/script up screenshot taking in SMILI?

A: The scripts are already in the SMILI repository in 'scripts/'.

You have two options:
python multi-threaded script for milxOverlay as batch_overlay.py
or have the sMILX do it via the python console (python plugin) as smilx_screenshot*.py
The latter is more powerful as you can access all of the SMILI API via python, whereas only what is implemented in the app in the former.

To build python plugin install libpythonqt and python2.7-dev packages from repository. The package I will give you should have it.

Q: Is it possible to save the screenshots at double the resolution?

A: The screenshot resolution is the same as window size, which can be controlled in five ways:
Set the magnification factor in the sMILX preferences if using sMILX
milxOverlay has width and height command line options (--width and --height)
In the SMILI API (via python console), the window size can be set directly
There is the default window size option in the sMILX preferences.
Maximise the window when taking the screenshot.

Q: What library versions do I use?

A: I use ITK 3.20.1 for SSM plugin, but ITK 4 also works but need ITK 4 build of milx-msk (which will be broken so use make -k).
I use ITK 4.5 and VTK 6.1 (with Qt 4, Qt 5 not supported as yet) for ‘full proper’ version. VTK 5 has a number of bugs related to image display.
You can use ITK with or without review, but with review has more labelling related features.
Use vtkFFMPEGIO for the animate plugin, note that VTK 5 requires ffmpeg v1.0, but VTK 6 will build with newer v2.0 (Ubuntu repository version of VTK has everything built you will need, so I never build Qt, ITK or VTK myself only ITK 3 these days).
