Subclassed Constructors ------
Ensure that the contextSystem variable is passed to the base class from your derived class to enable the context menu.

Context/File Menus for Data Windows -------
When subclassing windows such as models or images, you should 
 - add a createMenu member with the context menu being created
 - an entry to the conextMenuEvent member to show this as a context menu
 - ensure the contextMenu variable is allocated especially if the class does not have a basicContextMenu member
