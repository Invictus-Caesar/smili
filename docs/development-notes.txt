Subclassed Constructors ------
Ensure that the contextSystem variable is passed to the base class from your derived class to enable the context menu.

Context/File Menus for Data Windows -------
When subclassing windows such as models or images, you should 
 - add a createMenu member with the context menu being created
 - an entry to the conextMenuEvent member to show this as a context menu
 - ensure the contextMenu variable is allocated especially if the class does not have a basicContextMenu member
 
Linked Views -------
milxQtMain::transferViewToWindows holds the implementation of link windows.
All windows make connection to this member and executed if actionLinkWindows->isChecked()

Image Slices (Changing) -------
Slices are changed using mouse wheel in vtkInteractorStyleImage2.
The arrow keys change slices in updateSlice of milxQtImage

Tracking Views in Images -------
This mode is for linking images in multi-view
