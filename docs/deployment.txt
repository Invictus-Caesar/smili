Mac OSX Deployment Notes
----------------------------------
Understanding SDKROOT and MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET variables.
From http://www.clarkcox.com/blog/2009/06/23/sdks-and-deployment-targets/
"Using these two build settings you can easily build a single binary of your application that supports the latest and the greatest, yet gracefully degrades when running on older OSes. 
The basic rules of thumb:
Set the Base SDK to the lowest value that will still support all of the features that you use
Set the deployment target to the lowest OS version on which you plan to run.
Check, at runtime, for any features that you use that don’t exist in the version of the OS that matches your deployment target."

Via http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10165335/can-cmake-specify-the-base-sdk-on-mac-os-x
At the command-line:
MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.6

cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT=/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.7.sdk/ -DCMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.7 ../..

CMakeLists.txt:

set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "--sysroot ${CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT} ${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS}")

Note that for XCode, the SDK is in /Applications/XCode.app/Contents/...

Compatibility ----
For deployment into 10.6 upto 10.9 I used:
ccmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.9.sdk/ -DCMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.6 ..

Get the 10.6 SDK
Download XCode 4.3.3, mount then 'Package Contents' and copy the SDK folder to above path where the other SDKs are.

Packaging ----
Easy for Qt libraries to conflict (SQLite or other plugins), i.e. the error:
"On Mac OS X, you might be loading two sets of Qt binaries into the same process"
so use the CMake DeplotQt4 module
http://cmake.org/cmake/help/v2.8.8/cmake.html#module:DeployQt4
With guide from its author

Plugins ----
FFMPEG

Build with the fgollowing to get universal library
./configure --sysroot=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.9.sdk --extra-cflags="-isysroot /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.9.sdk -DMACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.6 -mmacosx-version-min=10.6" --enable-shared --prefix=/Users/uqscha22/Dev/Install
